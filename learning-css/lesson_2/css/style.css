}

p {
    color: rgba(0,0,0,0.5); /* Adds an alpha channel which controls the transparency. Instead of 0-255 alpha channel value varies from 0-1 .*/
}

/* 
Another way to color is to use hexadecimal . Hexadecimal(or hex) color codes in CSS are a way to specify colors using a six-character code preceded by a # symbol. The six characters represent the intensities of red, green, and blue (RGB), which combine to form the final color 

A hex color is structured as follows:

#RRGGBB

RR: Represents the red component (00 to ff, in hexadecimal).
GG: Represents the green component (00 to ff).
BB: Represents the blue component (00 to ff).

Each component (RR, GG, BB) is a two-digit hexadecimal number, ranging from 00 (the minimum intensity) to ff (the maximum intensity, or 255 in decimal).

Examples:

color: #000000; is pure black
color: #ffffff; is pure white
color: #ff0000; is red
color: #0000ff; is blue
color: #00ff00; is green
color: #808080; is gray

Shorthand Hex Codes

If both digits of each color component are the same, you can use shorthand notation:

    Example: #ffAA77 can be shortened to #fA7.
        Full form: #ffAABB
        Shorthand: #fAB

Adding Transparency (Hex with Alpha)

Hex colors can also include transparency using an 8-character code where the last two digits represent the alpha (opacity) level:

#RRGGBBAA

AAA: Opacity level, where 00 is fully transparent and ff is fully opaque.

Example: #ff573380

    Red = ff, Green = 57, Blue = 33, Alpha = 80 (about 50% transparent).


p {
    color: #0f0;
}
*/

/* 
Another way to set colors is through hsl or hsla (Hue, Saturation, and Lightness, with A in HSLA representing Alpha (transparency)) .

Hue: Represents the color on the color wheel, ranging from 0 to 360 degrees.

    0° = Red
    120° = Green
    240° = Blue

Saturation: Represents the intensity of the color, from 0% (gray/desaturated) to 100% (full color).

Lightness: Represents the brightness of the color, from 0% (black) to 100% (white).

Example: 

color: hsl(0, 100%, 50%); a pure red color

The alpha value ranges from 0 (completely transparent) to 1 (fully opaque).

Example: 

color: hsla(0, 100%, 50%, 0.5); semi-transparent red

You can also use a contrast checker to create a more effective and user-friendly design.
